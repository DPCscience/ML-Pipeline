    "First, note that before the grid search started running, the model told you what your positive and negative class strings were and how many instances would be in each class for each replicate. This is an important feature in the ML-Pipeline. Training a ML classifier with unbalanced data, or data with different numbers of each instance, can cause your model to be biased toward predicting the more numerous class. For example, if you train a model using 100 positive examples and 100,000 negative examples, your model would do well to just call instance negative! Therefore, in this pipeline, the larger classes are randomly downsampled to generate balanced datasets. To ensure we still utilize as much data as possible, this downsampling is done independelty for each replicate (-n). \n",

For each replicate, an instance is classified as pos if pp > threshold, which is defined as value between 0.001-0.999 that maximises the F-measure. While the performance metrics generated by the pipeline are calcuated for each replicate independently, we want to be able to make a final statement about which instances were called as positive and which were called as negative. You'll find those results in this file. To make this final call we calculated the mean threshold and the mean pp for each instance and called the instance pos if the mean pp > mean threshold. \n",

The Final Full CM represents the final TP, TN, FP, and FN results from the final pos/neg classifications (descirbed above in _scores) for all instances in your input dataset. \n",

This is not the case for multi-class predictions. Using our model above as an example, a ML model that was randomly guessing top, middle, or bottom, would only be correct ~33% of the time.
