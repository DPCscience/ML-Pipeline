The default and a commonly used fold number is -cv 10, however, if you have a small dataset, using fewer folds (-cv 5) may perform better. In the extreme case, if you have very few instances to train on, you can set -cv equal to the number of instances in your dataset, allowing you to perform leave one out [LOO](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/tut5/node42.html) cross validation.\n",

This is an important feature in the ML-Pipeline. Training a ML classifier with unbalanced data, or data with different numbers of each instance, can cause your model to be biased toward predicting the more numerous class. For example, if you train a model using 100 positive examples and 100,000 negative examples, your model would do well to just call instance negative! Therefore, in this pipeline, the larger classes are randomly downsampled to generate balanced datasets. To ensure we still utilize as much data as possible, this downsampling is done independelty for each replicate (-n). \n",

For each replicate, an instance is classified as pos if pp > threshold, which is defined as value between 0.001-0.999 that maximises the F-measure. While the performance metrics generated by the pipeline are calcuated for each replicate independently, we want to be able to make a final statement about which instances were called as positive and which were called as negative.

This is not the case for multi-class predictions. Using our model above as an example, a ML model that was randomly guessing top, middle, or bottom, would only be correct ~33% of the time.
