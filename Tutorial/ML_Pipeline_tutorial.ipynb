This is an important feature in the ML-Pipeline. Training a ML classifier with unbalanced data, or data with different numbers of each instance, can cause your model to be biased toward predicting the more numerous class. For example, if you train a model using 100 positive examples and 100,000 negative examples, your model would do well to just call instance negative!

While the performance metrics generated by the pipeline are calcuated for each replicate independently, we want to be able to make a final statement about which instances were called as positive and which were called as negative.
