Training a ML classifier with unbalanced data, or data with different numbers of each instance, can cause your model to be biased toward predicting the more numerous class. For example, if you train a model using 100 positive examples and 100,000 negative examples, your model would do well to just call instance negative!

The pp score represents how confident the model was in its classification, where a pp=1 means it is certain the instance is positive and pp=0 means it is certain the instance is negative. For each replicate, an instance is classified as pos if pp > threshold, which is defined as value between 0.001-0.999 that maximises the F-measure. While the performance metrics generated by the pipeline are calcuated for each replicate independently, we want to be able to make a final statement about which instances were called as positive and which were called as negative. You'll find those results in this file. To make this final call we calculated the mean threshold and the mean pp for each instance and called the instance pos if the mean pp > mean threshold. \n",

This is not the case for multi-class predictions. Using our model above as an example, a ML model that was randomly guessing top, middle, or bottom, would only be correct ~33% of the time. That means models performing with >33% accuracy are performing better than random expectation.*\n",

Macro performance metrics are generated by taking the average of all the micro performance metrics. These scores are what are printed in the command line. "
